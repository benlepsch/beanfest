# IMPORTANT
The URL in the github description is the game that's in development right now, meaning that it's buggy and unfinished.

If you want to play a version that is more finished than this one (you can move and shoot), go to [this website](http://ben.jacktimmins.com/multiplayer_map).

## about beanfest

[beanfest discord server](https://discord.gg/k6ejsmg)

beanfest is a bean-themed FFA game that's completely in-browser. It's designed this way for all the students with chromebooks who want to play a bean-themed FFA game but can't download games onto their computers because they have chromebooks. 

there isn't a release date set for the actual beanfest release yet but that's because i'm incredibly lazy

upcoming changes:

 - finish/fix movement
 - add bullets (baked bean cans)
 - add a kill feed/kill leaders 
 - add an alert after you die (think the "you were eliminated by \<player\>" from overwatch)
 - make a patreon 
 - start a beanfest esports scene
  
and then finally:
 - make beanfest a battle royale
